# The Storyteller's Revenge - Unity VR 360 Video Project

"The Storyteller's Revenge" is a virtual reality experience created by Pamela Cook of [LightBe Corp](https://www.lightbe.com/). This experience allows a person to choose between viewing two 360 video clips using video controls.

To play: You will see a title screen to begin the application where you have a chance to watch one of two videos. Movie controls will allow you to switch between the two videos. At the end of the video you can restart the movie viewing. It will replay the movie that you were last playing. You can also exit the application when a movie ends. 

This game was created using Unity 2017.4.7f1 and GoogleVR SDK 1.120.0 for iOS with the minimum version of 10.0. This project has been executed on an iPhone 6 Plus running the latest stable version of both iOS 11 and iOS 12.
