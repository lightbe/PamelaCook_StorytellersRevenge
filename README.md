# The Storyteller's Revenge by Pamela Cook

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017). My project is tested on an iPhone 6 Plus running the latest version of iOS 11.

To play: You will see a title screen to begin the application where you have a chance to watch one of two videos. Movie controls will allow you to switch between the two videos. At the end of the video you can restart the movie viewing. It will replay the movie that you were last playing. You can also exit the application when a movie ends. 

## How It Works
This application allows a person to choose between two 360 videos using video controls.

## Versions
- Unity 2017.4.7f1
- GVR Unity SDK v1.120.0
